You are given a 2D matrix of dimension m x n and a positive integer r. You have to rotate the matrix r times and print the resultant matrix. Rotation should be in anti-clockwise direction.


It is guaranteed that the minimum of m and n will be even.

As an example rotate the Start matrix by 2:

    Start         First           Second
     1 2 3 4       2  3  4  5      3  4  5  6
    12 1 2 5  ->   1  2  3  6 ->   2  3  4  7
    11 4 3 6      12  1  4  7      1  2  1  8
    10 9 8 7      11 10  9  8     12 11 10  9
