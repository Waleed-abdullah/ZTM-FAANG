/*
There are two types of heaps max and min heaps, they are complete binary trees.

Max Heap: every node has children with values smaller than itself
Min Heap: every node has children with values greater than itself

Max and Min heaps are used to implement priority queues

The space and time complexity is given as:
Space: O(n)
Insertion: O(log n)
Deletion: O(log n)
